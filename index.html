    <h2>Assignment 2: The IT World</h2> 
    <p>Team Profile
        1.	Team Name
        I make a final decision to name my group in the future is Dande. Because this name comes with me since 2016, my fashion brand is first created using this name and it sounds similar to my name so I think it could bring me luck in business.
        2.	Team Profile
        On assignment 1, I completed online personality tests, which I have attached three tests below:
         
         
         
        As a visual learning person, I learn through visualizing what I see in a picture. This learning will occasionally result in a few minor errors. Learning by abstraction will let us picture an item in general, but it will not be as accurate as a tactile learner in terms of depth. Moreover, I'm an introvert, but not in the way you may think. Sometimes I want to work alone in a confined location, while other times I want to work in an open environment, asking questions and discovering solutions. I believe myself to be a person with low energy; a part of me is always busy yet lethargic, allowing things to pile up. In the conclusion, I am a person who regards art as life. I view things and analyze them as imagination through visuals. Everything comes from my feelings. My strength is that I can perceive things normally thought upon by people.
        That is why I am looking for teammates who contain tactile and energy learning style ability. Tactile learning is a method that says people can learn via touch, sense, and movement. This is also called childhood learning. This method of learning stresses that learning is done by many, and energy learning person is someone that always serious and hard at work, even if they make numerous mistakes, they can swiftly and effectively fix them. Moreover, they are never late and always having the opportunity to efficiently plan your timetable.
        Combining into a group having a favorable influence on productivity. Tactile and visual learning, I believe, are the two most essential elements. And then there is the strength to provide greater morale and performance to teammates based on both types of study.
        Tools
        I have friends studying in RMIT with high income and stable jobs and even starting their 
        Project Ideas
        a.	Overview: 
        The project utilizes Unity as a game engine to create a product that serve as a way of entertainment for consumers of smart devices of any kind. The idea for the product is inspired by the popular video game franchise "RUST". RUST, developed by 
        Facepunch Studios and published by Steam, is a survival, role-playing game. Although this project is based most on the RUST concept and a few unique item statistics from Green Hell which developed by Creepy Jar, it has its own style and gameplay that distinguishes it. The project is named by GPRP, just a temporary name for now.
        b.	Motivation:
        In the 1990s, a more distinct modern genre of survival games began to develop, although not before the start of the 21st century. UnReal World was established in 1992 by Sami Maaranen and is currently in continuous development. An early example of survival game genre. Scott Alexander cited games are wonderful for socialization; thus, it makes sense to increase popularity with a focus on collaboration for survival. All things considered; survival games won't soon die out. They just only grow in the field.
        c.	Description:
        Before we talk about this project, we need to know what survival game really is. Players will encounter a huge open environment with ecosystems similar to real life, such as food, water, animals, and people, similar to RUST and Green Hell. We must survive in a hostile world filled with lethal dangers. Players will see how other players murder each other in RUST or cannibal tribes in Green Hell. That's all a survival game provides us with, nothing too difficult in terms of developing a concept. However, it will provide such a rich experience that we will have to change the gameplay daily.
        So, what will we alter in this project to make it more interesting and appealing to players? The creator did not create RUST or Green Hell for the purpose of combining and storing data. When developers wipe their servers on a biweekly or monthly basis, it always irritates certain gamers. This is because they want people who come in later to experience the fairness after the prior person has logged in for several hours. RUST, on the other hand, simply transmits the experience of one player to another. Green Hell, on the other hand, always maintains all the player's data and lets them select when to keep and when to destroy the data. The disadvantage of Green Hell is that it is a survival game but cannot communicate with other players, only with AI.
        Let's get started on the primary project. In a huge open universe, a character will be formed. With HP (Health Points) representing the character's health and a UI bar displaying the character's hunger and mood levels. Depending on whether the surroundings are hot or cold, the character will lose blood in proportion to the severity of the weather. If the character runs or leaps, the hunger stat will rapidly drop as the number of times the character is active increases. To survive hunger, players must locate food such as fruits, mushrooms, veggies, or meat in the game's real-life surroundings. Furthermore, they must understand how to use trees for timber and silk for clothes. What remains of this game is to locate objects on the map, to be able to craft self-defense weapons while venturing into the wilderness or where there are cannibal tribes or bandits, or to gather construction materials. When other players are chasing you to steal you of what the player has, build yourself a haven.
        And what is distinctive about this project is always to save player information to ensure it is balanced for new and existing gamers. The developer updates players every month with a new city, existing players stay in the old town and new players can join the new town. But to make it possible for old people and new people to get between towns, the game requires players to remain active for 14 days to move between towns. It's because the newbie is given time to learn and to play like an old one when the two together provide equilibrium.
        d.	Tools and Technologies:
        This project will be developed using the Unity program. Originally, I planned to use 3D Max to draw basic characters, but Unity offers support for this and I find it much simpler. Furthermore, I picked a virtual physical server to host and test this game so that several players may enjoy it at the same time. It's known as a VPS (Virtual Private Server), and I've used it for past game projects and found it to be quite beneficial for low-budget game developers. The game will operate on PCs running Windows 7 64bit and above. There is also a Mac version.
        e.	Skills Required:
        By far, I believe the most important skill required to develop this project is C# or Python programming on the Unity platform. Although Unity provides less coding help, the fundamentals of coding in your chosen language are necessary. As previously said, a virtual server will be required for the development of this project, which will follow it from start to finish. This project also necessitates the use of a personal computer or laptop, there will be a minimum system requirement to experience this well.
        f.	Outcome:
        This project will become the most anticipated set of games if everything is in order and in its right order, with trial-and-error step by step. Because it will feature the most realistic survival gameplay that RUST has produced, but it will also address the faults that the developer RUST did not make, which fans expect to see. Along with the gameplay of Green Hell, where the player is experienced with both other players and the AI of the game, I modified the weak point of both games to offer this project a new spin. innovated while maintaining the fundamentals of the survival game genre that gamers desired. This initiative will have a significant impact on the survival gaming community. It will be a new turning point that transforms the outlook for survival game creators while yet maintaining the ultimate balance for new players.
